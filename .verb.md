Install this app on your preferred account: [Standard Release GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/standard-release) 

Automatically publish GitHub releases, based on commits that follows [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) specification.  
Pretty similar to the [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release), but only an App.

**[back to top](#thetop)**

## Usual Flow

This app works best with it's [@standard-release/cli](https://github.com/standard-release/cli) for npm publishing, but is not limited to it!  
So in case you want to combine both, follow this steps:

1. Install this App
2. Add your `NPM_TOKEN` env variable (needed for the CLI only) in your CI
3. Install [`@standard-release/cli`](https://github.com/standard-release/cli) (as devDependency for example) 
4. Configure your CI to run `standard-release` only on master branch

_Note: If you don't want automatic publish on continuous integration services, but want to run it locally whenever you want, then you should run `standard-release --no-ci` instead. See the cli docs for more info._

## Alternative Flow

Otherwise, you still can use only the App and leave the npm publishing to another tool, for example [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release) or [standard-version][], or Sindre's [np](https://npm.im/np). In this case the step is one: just install that app on your preferred account (your own or to some organization).

Basically, how this app works is pretty simple. It will listen to all CI jobs to finish successfully and then publish a GitHub Release. If some of the CI stuff fail, it won't do anything. The CI detection is based on a [status name check](https://github.com/standard-release/app/blob/1a3e8119d75f7385b354045eeb0858ef94d58720/src/index.js#L12-L19), so it works for Travis, CircleCI, AppVeyor and others.
